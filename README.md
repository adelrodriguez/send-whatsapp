# Send WhatsApp Messages Without the Hassle

Site to send WhatsApp messages without adding contact information.

This is just a simple wrapper around the `wa.me` WhatsApp API. I built this because:

* We use WhatsApp a lot in my country, and people around me didn't know about the `wa.me` link.
* I'm lazy and formatting the phone numbers to the format required by the `wa.me` link was a pain (removing commas, parenthesis and adding country code). Now I can just copy a phone number from wherever and start a conversation!
* I wanted to try out Vite.
* I wanted to build a simple site without using any JS framework.
